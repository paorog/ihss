It&rsquo;s not exactly forgetting to get a Release of Information, but in my California, both will result in disciplinary action.</p><p>I can somewhat understand how a person can rationalize their drive from point a to b while drunk, but no matter how short, easy, or familiar the ride is, the potential for catastrophic consequences is not worth throwing away life (yours and your victim&rsquo;s), money, freedom, education, and training.. right in the dumpster.</p><h2>WORK HARD PLAY HARD</h2><p>It&rsquo;s important to unwind. Some people crack a book and drink tea. Others do yoga. Some exercise. Some people like to hang out with friends. And some people like to have a drink or 6 when they&rsquo;re with friends. In the company of friends, it&rsquo;s easy to let time pass as you think you&rsquo;re okay to drive.</p><p>When you find yourself in a situation where you&rsquo;re drinking, it&rsquo;s important to have a designated driver, number to a taxi company, or an Uber account.</p><h1>UBER</h1><p>[I&rsquo;m using &ldquo;Uber&rdquo; as a general term to describe your ride-sharing service of choice&hellip; This is the one I&rsquo;m most familiar with and that I&rsquo;ve used. This is not a paid post, however,&nbsp;clicking on links&nbsp;on this blog post to sign up benefits you and I because we both get a $20 credit for you signing up with my code.]</p><p><a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber is &ldquo;your personal driver&rdquo;.</a> On your smartphone, you can summon somebody to come pick you up and take you from Point A to Point B. <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/" target="_blank">Uber currently serves the following locales.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/ignaciop79ue" target="_blank">Signing up is easy</a>, but I recommended to do on a desktop (the app can be a little more cumbersome than it should be). You&rsquo;ll provide your:</p><ul><li>Basic information</li><li>Payment/Billing information</li><li>Done.</li></ul><h2>USING UBER</h2><p>Once your account is set up, it&rsquo;s as easy as downloading the app, plugging in your credentials, and telling the app to come and get you.</p><p><strong>Pricing.</strong> I&rsquo;m not quite sure what the formula is for Uber to charge you, but according to my receipt, they charge a base fee plus mileage plus time. You can always get an estimate by plugging in your starting and ending destination.</p><p><strong>Surge Pricing.</strong> When a lot of people are requesting rides, (or when Uber decides it should raise the price for whatever reason,) rides start to cost more than the baseline amount.</p><p><strong>Split sharing.</strong> Did you know you can split the fare of your ride? That&rsquo;s right! You make social work wages, so your pals can help out with the ride if they&rsquo;re with you.</p><p><strong>Getting picked up.</strong> Uber will show you who&rsquo;s coming to get you, including their name, model of car, and license plate number.</p><p><strong>Engage in Awkward Small Talk.</strong> Some Uber drivers will engage, others are less than amenable to making small talk. Can&rsquo;t go wrong with either choice.</p><p><strong>Obey The Golden Rule.</strong> Treat other cars as yours would want to be treated.</p><p><strong>Arrive at Destination.</strong> Get out of the car. Say thank you.</p><p>Too easy.</p><h2>MY EXPERIENCE USING UBER</h2><p>I have used Uber to take me to gathering with friends at their home, our bar, or restaurant. Even if I limited myself to one drink, and in spite of my BMI number being higher than my caseload count), In my state, if I am pulled over with alcohol in my system, I can get hit with a &ldquo;wet reckless&rdquo; which my board will still punish. Which is secondary to the risk of hurting myself or someone else. Better safe than sorry.</p><p>The first time I used Uber was a little awkward. First thing was that on 7 PM on a Saturday, I hit surge pricing, meaning that my trip was going to cost something like 1.7X the normal amount that it would&hellip; But I waited five minutes and the pricing went back to normal.</p><p>I summoned my ride, told the app my exact location, and saw a little car start driving in my direction with the Uber [U] decal on the front windshield. A young guy about my age&nbsp;drove up to me standing on the sidewalk. The guy was cool and the car smelled new. We made small talk and he must&rsquo;ve been new because I had to give him directions as to when to turn, etc. I was wondering, do&nbsp;I tip? Turns out that you don&rsquo;t have to. There&rsquo;s a minimum fare you have to pay (I think mine was around $9) and if your trip doesn&rsquo;t meet the minimum, it rounds up to the minimum.</p><p>Uber is part of the Sharing or &ldquo;gig&rdquo; Economy, meaning that people who own a vehicle that falls within Uber&rsquo;s standards can essentially use it to taxi people around and make extra money on the side. AirBnB is another example of sharing the home that you own (or rent) to strangers for some side money while they use your pad for lodging. There have been times in my life where I&rsquo;ve wanted to earn an extra buck or two outside of my main gig, out of necessity. I&rsquo;m all for folks trying to make extra income to pay for their needs while providing a service to people, drunk or not. I&rsquo;m also game for competition between Uber, Lyft, and Taxis with better service and pricing for consumers.</p>', 3549, 'BP002', '2017-09-24 13:26:03', '2017-10-05 01:44:41', 0, NULL, NULL),

Digital, online, and other electronic<br>2 technology has transformed the nature of social work practice. Contemporary social workers can<br>3 provide services to clients by using online counseling, telephone counseling, video conferencing,<br>4 cybertherapy, self-guided Web-based interventions, electronic social networks, social<br>5 networking sites, e-mail, and text messages. Social workers&rsquo; routine use of digital technology&mdash;<br>6 especially social media, text messaging, and online and video chat&mdash;has created new ways to<br>7 interact and communicate with clients and raised fundamentally new questions about the<br>8 meaning of the social worker&ndash;client relationship.</p><p><strong>Revised by me to state:</strong></p><p>Social workers are compelled to use technology with increased frequency. Computer-based and mobile technology have transformed the nature of social work practice. Contemporary social workers can provide services to clients through technology tools that that connect social worker and client via voice, video, and messaging services to provide counseling, therapy, self-guided interventions, access to special communities, social networking, and information. In addition to using technology to engage and intervene with clients, social workers also routinely use technology to assess, case manage, document, and evaluate outcomes. These tools raise new questions about the fundamental meaning of the social worker-client relationship.</p><p><strong>Paragraph 2:</strong></p><p>9 In addition, social workers now use various forms of technology to access, gather, and otherwise<br>10 manage information about clients. Social workers maintain encrypted electronic records, store<br>11 sensitive information on their smartphones and in the &ldquo;cloud,&rdquo; and have the capacity to search<br>12 for information about clients using Internet search engines.</p><p><strong>Revised by me to state:</strong></p><p>Social workers use technology to access, gather, and manage information about clients. Social workers maintain encrypted electronic records, store sensitive information on mobile devices and on-demand services (e.g. &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;), and have the capacity to search for information for clients using online search engines.</p><p><strong>Paragraph 3:</strong></p><p>13 Digital technology has also influenced social work education. Today&rsquo;s undergraduate and<br>14 graduate students may take courses online, view prerecorded lectures posted on Internet-based<br>15 course sites, participate in online social work practice simulations, interact with fellow students<br>16 enrolled in a course from multiple locations around the world, and listen to podcasts. Social<br>17 workers may satisfy their continuing education requirements by enrolling in live online webinars<br>18 and attending lectures delivered from remote locations that are transmitted via satellite. They<br>19 may provide training, supervision, and consultation from distant locations using<br>20 videoconferencing technology.</p><p><strong>Revised by me to state:</strong></p><p>Online connectivity has greatly influenced social work education. Current undergraduate and graduate students may take courses online, view prerecorded lectures posted on internet-accessible course sites, participate in online social work practice simulations, interact with other students enrolled in a course that are situated in multiple geographic locations, and listen to educational podcasts. Social workers often satisfy their continuing education requirements by enrolling in online webinars, many of which are on-demand or live. Social workers may provide training, supervision, and consultation from distant locations using tele-conferencing technology.</p><p><strong>Paragraph 4:</strong></p><p>21 Social workers&rsquo; increasing use of technology has created new ethical challenges, especially<br>22 related to issues of informed consent; privacy and confidentiality; boundaries, dual relationships,<br>23 and conflicts of interest; practitioner competence; client records and documentation; collegial<br>24 relationships; and social work education. These dramatic developments require new and<br>25 unprecedented practice standards that contemporary social workers need to consider. These<br>26 standards address social workers&rsquo; use of digital and other electronic technology to (a) provide<br>27 information to the public; (b) design and deliver services; (c) gather, manage, store, and access<br>28 information about clients; (d) communicate with and about clients; and (e) educate social<br>29 workers. They are designed to guide social workers&rsquo; use of technology; enhance social workers&rsquo;<br>30 awareness of their ethical responsibilities when using technology; and inform social workers,<br>31 employers, and the public about practice standards pertaining to the use of technology in social<br>32 work.

These dramatic developments require new and concise practice standards that contemporary social workers need to consider. These standards guide social workers to use computer and mobile-based technology to (a) provide information to the public; (b) design and deliver services; (c) gather, manage, store, and access information about clients; (d) communicate with and about clients; (e)educate social workers, and (f) manage their personal conduct on social media. These standards are designed to empower social workers in their use of technology, enhance awareness of social worker ethical responsibilities when using technology; and inform social workers, their employers, and the public [consumers?] about practice standards pertaining to the use of technology in social work. Social workers should consider implementing these standards in conjunction with relevant social work laws (including statues, regulations, rules, and case law) and existing standards set forth by the National Association of Social Workers Code of Ethics (2009). As technology changes, the standards provided here should be adapted and modified as needed to ensure that ethical, competent, and moral social work practice is delivered to clients.</p><h2>SECTION 1: PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC</h2><p>Standard 1.01: Ethics and Values<br>Standard 1.02: Representation of Self and Accuracy of Information</p><p><strong><em>This section has semantic revisions that I&rsquo;m currently working on</em></strong></p><h2>SECTION 2: DESIGNING AND DELIVERING SERVICES</h2><p>Part A: Individuals, Families, and Groups</p><p>Standard 2.01: Ethical Use of Technology to Deliver Social Work Services<br>Standard 2.02: Services Requiring Licensure or Other Forms of Accreditation<br>Standard 2.03: Laws That Govern Provision of Social Work Services<br>Standard 2.04: Informed Consent: Discussing the Benefits and Risks of Providing Electronic Social Work Services<br>Standard 2.05: Competence: Knowledge and Skills Required When Using Technology to Provide Services<br>Standard 2.06: Confidentiality and the Use of Electronic Technology<br>Standard 2.07: Electronic Payments and Claims<br>Standard 2.08: Maintaining Professional Boundaries<br>Standard 2.09: Social Media Policy<br>Standard 2.10: Use of Personal Technology for Work Purposes<br>Standard 2.11: Unplanned Interruptions of Electronic Social Work Services<br>Standard 2.12: Responsibility in Emergency Circumstances<br>Standard 2.13: Digital and Online Testimonials<br>Standard 2.14: Assessing Clients&rsquo; Relationships with Technology</p><p>Part B: Communities, Organizations, Administration, and Policy</p><p>Standard 2.15: Organizing and Advocacy<br>Standard 2.16: Fundraising<br>Standard 2.17: Primary Commitment to Clients<br>Standard 2.18: Confidentiality<br>Standard 2.19: Appropriate Boundaries<br>Standard 2.20: Addressing Unique Needs<br>Standard 2.21: Access to Electronic Resources<br>Standard 2.22: Programmatic Needs Assessments and Evaluations<br>Standard 2.23: Current Knowledge and Competence<br>Standard 2.24: Control of Messages<br>Standard 2.25: Public Access to Information<br>Standard 2.26: Administration<br>Standard 2.27: Conducting Online Research<br>Standard 2.28: Social Media Policies</p><p><strong><em>This section (probably) has semantic revisions that I&rsquo;ll be working on, but I have yet to fully review this section.</em></strong></p><ul><li>Section 2.09: Social Media Policy: Should be changed &ldquo;Developing A Social Media Policy&rdquo;.

[I swear to God I saw this on my Facebook feed, posted by a colleague from graduate school, and I&rsquo;m still offended.]</li><li>Twitter Profile Name is &ldquo;FirstName LastName, LCSW&rdquo; and they talk about an ex who called them for a &ldquo;booty call&rdquo; the night before [this is a recent thing I&rsquo;ve seen].</li><li>Complains on Twitter about the difficult session they had today with a &ldquo;borderline&rdquo; client (In my Trainee day, I made a similar&nbsp;mistake, a dear colleague of mine pointed it out right away, and I deleted the Tweet).</li><li>Twitter profile indicates &ldquo;Social Worker&rdquo; and stream consists of incredibly potty-mouth, incendiary, or racist language.</li><li>Social worker identifies self as such, comments on a news story, declaring that the person in the article &ldquo;is clearly borderline or a sociopath&rdquo; and gives reasons why [I did not know the social worker in this case, but&nbsp;this incident&nbsp;was reported to&nbsp;my licensing board where this action resulted in disciplinary action and a fine because the social worker, in their capacity, identified themselves with their credential and diagnosed a person that was not their client.]</li></ul><p>The following expands on the above-noted sections</p><h3>Standard 6.XX: Identifying Oneself as a Social Worker</h3><ul><li>If you&rsquo;re going to identify as a social worker online, you have to abide&nbsp;by standards set forth by&nbsp;the NASW Code of Ethics.</li><li>If you chose to clearly identify yourself as a social worker, be&nbsp;aware of the Profession Code of Ethics mission, purpose, values, principles, and ethical standards when you&rsquo;re doing anything online whether it&rsquo;s social media, blogging, or participating in public discussions.</li></ul><h3>Standard 6.XX:&nbsp;Personal and Professional Social Media Profiles</h3><p>Social workers are entitled to a private life and personal social media profile.In a personal social media profile:</p><ul><li>A&nbsp;social worker can refer to their work, profession, etc., but they are encouraged to not disparage their profession or do harm to clients, intentionally or unintentionally.</li><li>A social worker should not talk about specific clients. (e.g. &ldquo;my bratty 1 PM today was such &nbsp;headache&rdquo;).</li><li>A social worker should abide by the&nbsp;NASW Code of Ethics in their personal&nbsp;profile (e.g. don&rsquo;t disparage clients, don&rsquo;t breach confidentiality, don&rsquo;t disparage other social workers, maintain human dignity of clients, etc.).</li><li>On a personal social media profile, a social worker should not list their credentials as there is implications that they are representing a part of their professional self on this profile.</li></ul><p>Social workers are encouraged to make a professional social media profile if they want to talk social work online on whatever venue they want.</p><ul><li>Social workers can list their&nbsp;credentials.</li><li>Social workers should be clear that&nbsp;they&nbsp;are not providing legal, ethical, clinical advice.</li><li>Social workers should direct interested parties to their website if they are seeking consultation, therapy, etc. or an outside resource if the interested party is looking for a resource beyond the scope of the social worker.</li><li>Social workers should not assess, diagnose, or provide treatment via social media.</li><li>Social workers are encouraged to discuss practice policy in shaping decisions and advocacy in our profession.</li></ul><h3>Standard 6.XX:&nbsp;Boundaries and Client interactions Online and on Social Media</h3><ul><li>Clients are naturally curious; some may Google You.</li><li>Social workers should be mindful that clients may be able to access your blog or online presence.</li><li>Social workers are discouraged to engage with clients online as this will cause boundary issues and the possibility for unintentional harm, confidentiality breaches, etc.</li><li>Social workers should actively lobby websites (where information can be posted about anonymously or freely) to remove their information without breaching client confidentiality. For example: a social worker should try to remove themselves from Yelp!, even if a client posted the information and is praising or complaining about them. In this example, the social worker should not engage with comments made about them, including endorse, dispute, etc. so that client confidentiality can be maintained.</li><li>Clients have avenues to express their grievances, which include licensing boards and professional associations.</li><li>If a client engages a social worker online, the social worker should do what they can to not cause harm to the client, but terminate the online relationship in an appropriate manner. They should refer to the Social Media Policy the should have developed (discussed in Section 2.09), and remind the client that they mutually agreed on the principles of the policy. If the client is an active client, a discussion on boundaries may be indicated.</li></ul><h3>Standard 6.XX:&nbsp;Advocacy and Advancing Social Work and Related Policy or Practice</h3><ul><li>Social workers are encouraged to discuss practice policy in shaping decisions and advocacy in our profession. These discussions can occur in public online forums such as message boards or chats organized on social media (e.g. Twitter chats, #MacroSW on Twitter).</li><li>Social workers are encouraged to share their knowledge, expertise, and opinions to advance the profession. This can be done via blog posts or social media participation.</li><li>Social workers should speak out against injustice, inequality, and promote human dignity.</li></ul><h3>Standard 6.XX:&nbsp;Citing the Work of Others</h3><ul><li>Whenever possible, social workers should give credit to works others have made online.</li><li>In social media or online blog posts, social workers often use or borrow ideas, pictures, or content from other parties and those parties should be given credit or attribution.</li><li>A due diligence should be made to find the source of the original content for the purpose of attribution.</li><li>Social workers should license their content as free or easily accessible and attributable (e.g. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a>).</li><li>When a social worker reposts content on sharing sites, e.g. Tumblr, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter the obligation falls on the original post author to give proper attribution, whether it is their own work of the work of someone else. The original post should contain the URL where the post was found if possible, or the username (@username, e.g. Twitter) of the content creator.</li></ul><p>The following is borrowed from Section 4.08: Acknowledging Credit,&nbsp;in the&nbsp;NASW Code of Ethics</p><ul><li>Social workers should take responsibility and credit, including authorship credit, only for work they have actually performed and to which they have contributed.</li><li>Social workers should honestly acknowledge the work of and the contributions made by others.</li></ul>', 3401, 'BP002', '2017-09-24 13:30:23', '2017-10-05 01:44:25', 0, NULL, NULL),

They pursue poverty alleviation goals with entrepreneurial zeal, business methods and the courage to innovate and overcome traditional practices. A social entrepreneur, similar to a business entrepreneur, builds strong and sustainable organizations, which are either set up as not-for-profits or companies.</span></p><p><em>A social entrepreneur is a leader or pragmatic visionary who:</em></p><ul><li>Achieves large scale, systemic and sustainable social change through a new invention, a different approach, a more rigorous application of known technologies or strategies, or a combination of these.</li><li>Focuses first and foremost on the social and/or ecological value creation and tries to optimize the financial value creation.</li><li>Innovates by finding a new product, a new service, or a new approach to a social problem.&nbsp;</li><li>Continuously refines and adapts approach in response to feedback.&nbsp;</li><li>Combines the characteristics represented by Richard Branson and Mother Teresa.</li></ul><p>The Schwab Foundation employs the following criteria when looking for leading social entrepreneurs: Innovation, Sustainability, Reach and social impact. &nbsp;</p><p><em>Social entrepreneurs share some come common traits including:</em></p><ul><li>An unwavering belief in the innate capacity of all people to contribute meaningfully to economic and social development&nbsp;</li><li>A driving passion to make that happen.&nbsp;</li><li>A practical but innovative stance to a social problem, often using market principles and forces, coupled with dogged determination, that allows them to break away from constraints imposed by ideology or field of discipline, and pushes them to take risks that others wouldn&#39;t dare.&nbsp;</li><li>A zeal to measure and monitor their impact. Entrepreneurs have high standards, particularly in relation to their own organization&rsquo;s efforts and in response to the communities with which they engage. Data, both quantitative and qualitative, are their key tools, guiding continuous feedback and improvement.&nbsp;</li><li><span data-mce-mark="1">A healthy impatience. Social Entrepreneurs cannot sit back and wait for change to happen &ndash; they are the change drivers.</span></li></ul><p><strong>What is Social Entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>Social entrepreneurship is&nbsp;</p><ul><li>About applying practical, innovative and sustainable approaches to benefit society in general, with an emphasis on those who are marginalized and poor.</li><li>A term that captures a unique approach to economic and social problems, an approach that cuts across sectors and disciplines grounded in certain values and processes that are common to each social entrepreneur, independent of whether his/ her area of focus has been education, health, welfare reform, human rights, workers&#39; rights, environment, economic development, agriculture, etc., or whether the organizations they set up are non-profit or for-profit entities.</li><li>It is this approach that sets the social entrepreneur apart from the rest of the crowd of well-meaning people and organizations who dedicate their lives to social improvement.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About organizational models</strong></p><p><em>Leveraged non-profit ventures </em></p><p>The entrepreneur sets up a non-profit organization to drive the adoption of an innovation that addresses a market or government failure. In doing so, the entrepreneur engages a cross section of society, including private and public organizations, to drive forward the innovation through a multiplier effect. Leveraged non-profit ventures continuously depend on outside philanthropic funding, but their longer term sustainability is often enhanced given that the partners have a vested interest in the continuation of the venture.</p><p><em>Hybrid non-profit ventures </em></p><p>The entrepreneur sets up a non-profit organization but the model includes some degree of cost-recovery through the sale of goods and services to a cross section of institutions, public and private, as well as to target population groups. Often, the entrepreneur sets up several legal entities to accommodate the earning of an income and the charitable expenditures in an optimal structure. To be able to sustain the transformation activities in full and address the needs of clients, who are often poor or marginalized from society, the entrepreneur must mobilize other sources of funding from the public and/or philanthropic sectors. Such funds can be in the form of grants or loans, and even quasi-equity.</p><p><em>Social business ventures </em></p><p>The entrepreneur sets up a for-profit entity or business to provide a social or ecological product or service. While profits are ideally generated, the main aim is not to maximize financial returns for shareholders but to grow the social venture and reach more people in need. Wealth accumulation is not a priority and profits are reinvested in the enterprise to fund expansion. The entrepreneur of a social business venture seeks investors who are interested in combining financial and social returns on their investments.</p>', 7934, 'BP002', '2017-10-04 17:22:44', '2017-10-05 01:44:33', 0, NULL, NULL),
